This program is an interface that connects to Beckhoff or Allen-Bradley PLCs, reads charts the data on the interface, as well as store information in a mariadb database. To run, open a terminal and run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all python dependencies. To read and write data to/from the database, the database must be created. This will be automated in the future.
